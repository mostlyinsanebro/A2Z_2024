Solution:-

Approach:- Since we have to find the smallest index having value grrater than x, so go to the left of the mid if arr[mid]==x and update ans = mid.
If arr[mid]>x, then save it in ans and go to the left of the array.
If arr[mid]<x, then go to the right of the array and do not save the sanswer because we want such an element which is greater than x.

Code:-
       public static int lowerBound(int []arr, int n, int x) {
        // Write your code here
        int l=0,r=n-1,mid=0,ans=n;

        while(l<=r)
        {
            mid=(l+r)/2;

            if(arr[mid]>=x)
            {
                ans = mid;
                r = mid-1;
            }
            else 
             l=mid+1;
              
        }

        return ans;
  }

T.C. -> O(logN)
S.C. -> O(1)
