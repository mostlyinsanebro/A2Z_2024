Solution:-
Brute Force:- The concept used is that whatever element is smaller than k in the array will take one place and we will have to increase k by 1. This way we will
get the kth missing element from an array starting from 1. Initially, take k as the answer because k can potentially be the smallest missing number in the array.
Traverse the array after that and whenever you find a smaller element than k, increase k by 1, this will make sure that each smaller element takes makes up for one
place before k, so we will have to increase k by 1 and when element is >k, we break out of the loop and return k.
Code:-

    public static int missingK(int[] vec, int n, int k) {
        // Write your code here.
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(vec[i]<=k) k++;
            else break;
        }
        return k;
    }

T.C. -> O(N)
S.C. -> O(1)
