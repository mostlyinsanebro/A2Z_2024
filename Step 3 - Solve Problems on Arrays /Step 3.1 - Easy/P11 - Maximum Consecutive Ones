Solution:-
Optimal Approach:- The optimal approach is pretty straight forward in this.Take two variables c and max. If the element is 1 , then check if c is > max,
if yes then max the max as c. If element is an element which is !=1, then make c = 0 and go on further in the array.You will get the count of max consecutive 1's
on reaching the end of array.

Code:-
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int c=0,max=0;

        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]==1)
            {
                c++;
                max = Math.max(c,max);
            }
            else
            {
                c=0;
            }
        }

        return max;

    }
}
