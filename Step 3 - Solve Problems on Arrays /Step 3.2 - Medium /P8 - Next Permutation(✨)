Solution:-

Brute Force:- It involves three steps.
1. Create all possible permutations of array in sorted order using recursion and store them.
2. Do a linear search for the given permutation.
3. Print the next permutation. If the next permutation is the last of the list, then print the first permutation from the list.


T.C. -> O(N!*N) -- N! because there are N! permutations of an array and for every permutation there are N elements.
Note:- The T.C. is very large, thus, we will just mention this to the interviewer and move on to the optimal solution.


Optimal Solution:-
