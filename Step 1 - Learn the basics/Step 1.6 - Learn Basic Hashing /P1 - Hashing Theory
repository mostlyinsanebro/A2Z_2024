Hashing -> pre-storing and fetching

Suppose you are given an array of 10^5 and you are asked to find the frequencies of 10^5 numbers from that array. The most basic approach would be to traverse the array
for each element and then find the frequency of every element. This takes 10^10 time using this approach.

Now, 10^8 operations take 1 sec to execute, then 10^10 will take 100 seconds to execute which is a very large amount of time.
To reduce this time, hashing comes into the picture.

NUMBER HASHING:-
We can use number hashing in this scenario. Suppose we are given m numbers and we know that the max element that can occur is max. So, in order to find the frequency of each 
element in the array, we can create an array and use that for number hashing i.e. we will create the array as hash[max+1] and we will store the frequency of each element
at the corresponding index of the hash array and fetch it when needed.

Code -> 
import java. util.*;
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        int n= sc.nextInt();
        int arr[]= new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
        }

        // prestore
        int hash[]= new int[13];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            hash[arr[i]]++;
        }

        int t=sc.nextInt();
        for(int i=0;i<t;i++)
        {
            int inp = sc.nextInt();
            // fetch
            System.out.println(hash[inp]);
        }
    } 
}

// We can fetch the frequency of any element by doing hash[elemennt].

// Problem with this approach -> Inside main, the max limit for creating an array is 10^6 and it is 10^7 globally which can be problematic if we have max element greater than 10^7.
// Also, creating a hash array that big takes up too much space.



CHARACTER HASHING:-
In order to hash character arrays, we can do it very easily. If we are specified with the exact details that we have to store lowercase letters, then we will have to subtract 'a' from
each of the characters and then store that data in the character array. This way 'f' will be stored at 5th index as 'f'-'a' = 5 and so on and while retrieving, use the same approach.

If we have to store all the lowercase and uppercase letters, then simply use an array of size 256 since there are 256 characters and then do mapping accordingly 'f' and fetch 
accordingly as well, like hash['f'].

Code -> 
// specific to lowercase letters
import java. util.*;
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        Scanner sc =  new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = sc.nextLine();

        // pre-storing
        int hash[] = new int[26];
        //Since there are 26 characters in the array
        for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++)
        {
            char ch = str.charAt(i);
            hash[ch-'a']++;
        }
        
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        for(int i=0;i<t;i++)
        {
            String st = sc.next();
            char c = st.charAt(0);
            //fetching
            System.out.println(hash[c-'a']);
        }
    }
}


// for all characters
import java. util.*;
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        Scanner sc =  new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = sc.nextLine();

        // pre-storing
        int hash[] = new int[256];
        //Since there are 26 characters in the array
        for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++)
        {
            char ch = str.charAt(i);
            hash[ch]++;
        }
        
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        for(int i=0;i<t;i++)
        {
            String st = sc.next();
            char c = st.charAt(0);
            //fetching
            System.out.println(hash[c]);
        }
    }
}

Note:- There are no complications while hashing characters, therefore always use arrays to hash characters. For hashing numbers, there is some problem
cannot creating numbers greater than 10^7, so use the hash for that. Continuation is the problem ahead.

T.C. -> Ordered HashMap -> O(logN) in best,avg and worst case.
Unordered Map -> O(1) in best and avg case and O(N) in worst case.

Also, in the HashMap the values are not stored in a sorted fashion by value, use LinkedHashMap for that instead.

Use HashMap by default because the average and best case T.C. in case of storing and fetching is O(1) and it is O(N) in case of worst case. Now, the worst case
happens rarely, so prefer it.

If the worst case happens and this DS fails, then switch back to LinkedHashMap as it has best, avg, and worst case T.C. in case of storing and fetching as O(logN).
where N is the number of elements in the map DS.

The worst case happens due to Internal Collisions.

Hashing is done using various methods one of which is the division method.

Collision is a situation that happens when after using a hash internally by the system, the resultant is such that all the keys are hashed at the same hash and it is still
very difficult to find the key because the hashed chain still looks the same as the original array. This is the worst case in the case of an unordered map or HashMap.

Pair<Integer, Integer> can not be taken as a key in HashMap.


Note:- Traverse the HashMap in the following way.
map.forEach((key,value) -> {
// logic
});


HashMaps are created using 3 methods. You should know only about Division Method.
